# This tests various commands against a core from the OneAllocated program.  In
# this particular core there are multiple allocations because the code in gperftools
# allocates some and the code in OneAllocated.c allocates 1.
# anchored both by registers and stack for the current threaare multiple allocations
# because the code in gperftools allocates some and the code in OneAllocated.c
# allocates one allocation.  Unfortunately, one allocation is leaked even if the 
# the test code doesn't allocate any allocations.
# The leak is discussed in https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/issues/758

# Note that in general we don't do show free because the output may be
# quite large.
